{"name":"junki","tagline":"a.k.a munki for jamf","body":"junki\r\n=====\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/munkiforjamf/junki\r\n\r\n\r\nJunki somewhat emulates [munki](https://code.google.com/p/munki/) workflows and user experience for JAMF Software's [Casper Suite](http://www.jamfsoftware.com/products/casper-suite/).  \r\n\r\nCasper is the **best** all round management platform for all things Apple, but the fact it started it's life a few years a go when all Mac admins were using image based deployment workflows has meant there is a gap in functionality when it comes to post deployment patching. You can deploy patches via policies, but after looking at current best practices with Casper, I wasn't really happy with any current solutions or implementations.  \r\n\r\nMunki is the absolute, positiviely best way to deploy and *thin image* Macs. It does one thing, and it does it amazingly well. It can install software and ensure Macs are patched better than other system. Junki is munki inspired, and *hopefully* brings some of munki's greatness to Casper.\r\n\r\n#### junki isn't just a script... ####\r\n  \r\nIt's a patching and deployment methodology that;  \r\n\r\n* allows munki style deployment groups (*dev / beta / production / etc*)\r\n* will re-write your ASU catalogURL so the same deployment groups can be pointed at [NetSUS](https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/viewProduct.html?id=180&view=info) / [reposado](https://github.com/wdas/reposado) branches.\r\n* can chain incremental updaters (*eg. MS Office 2011 14.3.7, 14.3.8, 14.3.9*)\r\n* leverages existing existing Casper frameworks and methods (triggers, policies, smart groups) \r\n\r\nFrom a user experience persective it;   \r\n\r\n* provides a much needed Casper a GUI for software installation.\r\n* unifies Casper and Apple Software Update installations.\r\n* allows installations to be deferred, allows flexibiliy but maintaining compliance.\r\n* ensures users are logged out during installations.\r\n* integrates nicely with Self Service.\r\n\r\n![User Prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/munkiforjamf/junki/master/docs/images/prompt.png)\r\n\r\n### DISCLAIMER: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! ###\r\n\r\n*The documentation is sparse, the code is sloppy, it shouldn't be written in bash, but it works!\r\nI am not a coder, but I do think I have nailed the workflows and user experience.
